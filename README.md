# Sachsen Impfnotifier

This tool regularly checks the [vaccination portal of Saxony, Germany](https://sachsen.impfterminvergabe.de) for available appointments for specified vaccination centres. It simulates mouse clicks in a real browser from the login to the page where a found appointment needs to be confirmed.

It still requires some luck to get behind the waiting area and then find an appointment. It's recommended to watch [the DRK Sachsen Twitter channel](https://twitter.com/drksachsen) to get the release times of new appointments. 

After configuring the tool as described below, it can be left running on any of your machines and when an appointment will be found and needs to be confirmed, a system notification pops up. Additionally you can configure a Telegram or Matrix bot to get notified there as well.
